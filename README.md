# HALLOWEEN-TEAM-PROJECT
This project was designed and created by Anastassia Savostina, Anthony Pham, and Emily Vulaca. The task of this group project was to design and create a family-friendly Trunk-or-Treat website using the following languages:  HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The team designed the layout of the web pages using a wireframe and bootstrap was used to create the layout in the HTML.
Using the knowledge from class material, the team added animation and transitions to specific images and texts for visual effect.
A drop-down menu was created in the navbar with a link to the 2nd page: Activities and Candy.
A forms box was added below the main content of the home page for RSVP purposes.
